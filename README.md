# Slide Puzzle

Slide Puzzle creates a slide puzzle out of a jgraph output post script file.
It places the output into out.jpg in the root directory, and changes the file when input is provided on the command line

## Setup the repository
1. Install jgraph
2. Install convert / imagemagick
3. Clone this repository
4. Run make `make`

## Running the program
The makefile automatically runs an example slide puzzle, however any jgraph output post script file can be used by manually running the binary. Image files converted into post script do not work, you need post script generated by jgraph
```
./bin/puzzle <filename> <height> <width>
```
There are a few examples in the objects directory to try as well as the one that automatically is used.

### Arguments
* `filename` : path to the post script file to use
* `height` : the number of rows of the puzzle
* `width` : the number of columns of the puzzle

### Making your images
You must use jgraph to create a post script file to feed into this program.
